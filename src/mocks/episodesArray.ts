      "Rick, in a drunken state, takes his grandson, Morty, for a ride in his flying car and rambles on about how he plans to use a neutrino bomb to wipe out all life on Earth. Rick lands the vehicle on Morty's demand and passes out. The bomb activates by itself and seems to be left unchecked, but ultimately it is shown that life on Earth remains intact. After having breakfast with their family, Rick takes Morty to another dimension to collect seeds of 'Mega Trees', which Morty is forced to hide in his own rectum to get past intergalactic customs. However, Rick and Morty's cover is blown and they escape while engaging in a shootout with alien insect soldiers. Ultimately, the seeds briefly cause Morty to be highly intelligent, despite the fact that he missed a semester of school because he's been in adventures with Rick. This causes his parents to believe he is fine with his education, but this wastes the seeds, so Rick informs Morty that they need to go back and get more, while their aftereffects leave Morty writhing on the floor.",

However, without Rick and Morty knowing, those traits are transposed into toxic physical counterparts, characterized by Rick's arrogance and Morty's self-loathing. On the other hand, the Clean Rick becomes more considerate, and Clean Morty's confidence soars, which allows him to start dating girls. However, a side effect is that both Clean Rick and Morty effectively lose their ability to form emotional attachments. Swearing revenge on Clean Rick, Toxic Rick takes Toxic Morty, breaks out of the machine, and uses a moonlight tower to remake the whole Earth into a toxic version of itself. Clean Rick reverts the situation by poisoning Toxic Morty, correctly deducing that the true Rick considered his compassion for Morty a weakness, meaning Toxic Rick has inherited that trait. Toxic Rick angrily merges with Clean Rick to save Toxic Morty, bringing back the true Rick. Clean Morty avoids merging back with his toxic counterpart and goes on to live a life as a stockbroker in New York City.

He meets Morty at the Citadel, but they are accosted by Rick agents, who take them to see President Morty. There, President Morty reveals that he has used brain scans taken from Rick[b] to create a path outside of the Central Finite Curve — an isolated portion of the multiverse where Rick is the smartest man alive, having restricted access for Ricks from those where he is not. Flashbacks reveal Rick's backstory: after an alternate Rick murdered his wife Diane and a young Beth[c], he invented his portal gun to scour the multiverse for their killer, creating the Curve before reuniting with Morty's family. A group of Ricks joined forces to stop him as he killed countless Ricks, eventually becoming the Citadel. President Morty reveals that he is tired of the abuse that all Ricks within the Central Finite Curve will invariably inflict upon their Morty's, and seeks to destroy the Curve in order to escape; he hacks all the portal guns in the city, causing widespread death, then flees in an escape pod. Rick, Morty, and a group of survivors jettison themselves from the Citadel, which along with the Curve is destroyed by a black hole created by the hacked portal guns. President Morty steps into a yellow portal to an unknown destination.",
